# 🏚️ basement_collection  
 
This repository keeps **tiny**, **non-critical**, or **experimental** projects in one place to avoid creating unnecessary standalone repositories.

## 🧩 Why a Single Repo?  
- Keeps GitHub clean  
- Easy to maintain experiments  
- Only major projects get their own repo  

---

## 🧰 Requirements  
Each folder includes its own dependencies (if any).  
No global requirements.

---

## 📝 Notes  
- Each project is independent  
- Folder names use `snake_case`  
- Mini project READMEs are optional  

---

## 📜 License  
MIT License applies to all projects unless otherwise noted.

## 🎨 Visual Banner (Optional)
You can add a banner in `assets/banner.png` and enable it:

```md
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/banner.png" width="600" />
</p>
```

## 🧪 Project Playground
