# basement_collection

This repository contains small experiments, utilities, prototypes, and personal side projects that do not need their own standalone repository.  
Each project lives in its own folder and is fully independent.

## Purpose

The goal of this collection is to keep small or experimental work organized in a single place.  
Projects here may include:

- simple tools  
- test scripts  
- small hardware or software experiments  
- quick ideas  
- fun or learning-oriented mini projects
